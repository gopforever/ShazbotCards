## 🗂 How to Use

### Auto-load Demo Data
The dashboard automatically loads `data/sample-traffic-report.csv` on page load — no setup required.

### Upload Your Own eBay CSV Export
1. In your eBay Seller Hub → **Reports → Traffic** → download a **Listings Traffic Report** as CSV
2. On the dashboard, either:
   - **Drag & drop** the CSV onto the upload zone at the top, or
   - Click **"Upload New Report"** to browse for the file
3. The entire dashboard refreshes instantly with your new data

### Supported CSV Format
The tool handles eBay's quirky CSV format automatically:
- Disclaimer header rows (first 4 rows) are skipped
- `="358228910357"` item ID format is parsed correctly
- Percentage strings like `"1,150.0%"` with embedded commas are handled
- `-` values (no data) are treated as null

## 📊 Dashboard Sections

### 1. 📊 KPI Cards
At a glance:
- **Active Listings** — total cards in the report
- **Total Impressions** — how many times listings appeared in search
- **Avg CTR** — click-through rate (page views ÷ impressions)
- **Total Sold** — quantity sold in the report period
- **Zero Page Views** — listings that got impressions but no clicks (dead listings)
- **Avg Health Score** — composite 0–100 score across all listings

### 2. 🚨 Fix These First
Listings sorted by opportunity cost — high impressions with no clicks or no sales:
- 🔴 **Red** — High impressions, 0% CTR: review photos & title keywords
- 🟡 **Yellow** — Getting clicks but no sales: check pricing & description
- 🟢 **Green** — Has sales: maintain current strategy

**Action**: Start with the top red rows. These listings are getting seen but buyers aren't clicking — your title or thumbnail photo needs work.

### 3. 📈 Promoted vs. Organic
Side-by-side stats comparing your promoted listings vs. organic (non-promoted) ones:
- Total impressions, avg CTR, page views for each group
- Bar chart for visual comparison

**Is promoted worth it?** If promoted CTR is meaningfully higher than organic, the spend is driving quality traffic. If CTR is equal, consider reducing promoted budget.

### 4. 🔥 Trending Up / Trending Down
Cards sorted by day-over-day % change in organic impressions:
- **Trending Up** — gaining momentum (positive change)
- **Trending Down** — losing momentum (negative change)

**Action**: For trending-up cards, consider pricing higher. For trending-down cards, refresh the listing or lower price to generate velocity.

### 5. 🏈⚾🏀 Sport Breakdown
Auto-detected sport category (Football / Baseball / Basketball / Other) for each listing:
- Table: listings, impressions, sold, avg impressions per listing by sport
- Doughnut chart: impressions share by sport
- Bar chart: listing count by sport

**Action**: Focus purchasing and listing effort on the sport category with the best impressions and CTR.

### 6. 📋 All Listings Table
Fully searchable and sortable table of every listing:
- Click any **column header** to sort
- Use the **search box** to filter by card name or eBay item ID
- Click any **row** to expand a detailed breakdown panel
- Click the listing title to **open the eBay listing** in a new tab

### 7. 💡 Listing Health Score (0–100)
Composite score per listing based on:
- Impressions (40 pts, log-normalised vs. best listing)
- CTR (30 pts, 2%+ CTR = full marks)
- Top-20 search % (15 pts)
- Day-over-day organic trend (15 pts)

| Score | Badge | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 60–100 | 🟢 Green | Healthy — keep doing what you're doing |
| 30–59  | 🟡 Yellow | Needs attention — review title/pricing |
| 0–29   | 🔴 Red | Critical — consider refreshing or relisting |

## 🛡 Security
- Pure client-side static site — no data ever leaves your browser
- CSV files are parsed entirely in JavaScript in your local browser session
- `netlify.toml` enforces security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- `https://shazbotcards-ebay-proxy.vercel.app` is allowlisted in `connect-src` because the eBay
  OAuth token exchange **and all Trading API calls** are routed through this Vercel proxy.
  The browser never contacts `https://api.ebay.com` directly — all Trading API requests
  (including the "Sync from eBay" `GetMyeBaySelling` call) go to `POST /trading/sync` on the
  proxy, which forwards them server-to-server using the OAuth Bearer token. This avoids both
  CORS restrictions and CSP violations that would occur if the browser called the eBay API directly.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no build step
- **[Chart.js 4](https://www.chartjs.org/)** — for data visualizations (loaded from CDN)
- **Netlify** — static hosting with CDN and automatic HTTPS

## 🔑 eBay OAuth Integration

### App Keys & Credentials

1. Log in to the [eBay Developer Program](https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys)
2. Create or select an application to get your **App ID (Client ID)**, **Dev ID**, and **Cert ID (Client Secret)**
3. Open `js/config.js` and set:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  ebay: {
    environment: 'production', // 'production' or 'sandbox'
    appID:    'YourApp-ID-HERE',
    ruName:   'Your-RuName-HERE',
    proxyURL: 'https://your-backend-proxy.example.com',
    // ...
  }
};
```

### RuName / Redirect URI

eBay's OAuth flow requires `redirect_uri` to be the **RuName** (Redirect URL Name) string — **not** a full callback URL.  The RuName is created in the eBay Developer Portal and maps internally to your registered accepted/declined URLs.

- `js/ebayOAuth.js` passes `this.ruName` (e.g. `Scott_Pierce-ScottPie-cardsa-dnvvch`) as the `redirect_uri` parameter in both the authorize URL and the token exchange request.
- After the user grants consent, eBay redirects to the **Auth Accepted URL** you configured for that RuName in the Developer Portal (e.g. `https://projectebay.netlify.app/ebay-callback.html`).  You do **not** need to register the callback URL in `redirect_uri` directly.
- To change the callback URL (e.g. when switching from Netlify to GitHub Pages), update the **Auth Accepted URL** field for the RuName entry in the [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys) — no code change is required.

#### Required eBay Developer Portal Settings

1. Navigate to **My Account → Application → Auth Accepted URLs**
2. Set the **Auth Accepted URL** to your callback page (e.g. `https://projectebay.netlify.app/ebay-callback.html`)
3. Set the **Auth Declined URL** to your declined page (e.g. `https://projectebay.netlify.app/ebay-declined.html`)
4. Copy the generated **RuName** and paste it into `CONFIG.ebay.ruName` in `js/config.js`

### Proxy URL

The `proxyURL` points to a backend service that performs the OAuth token exchange using your **Client Secret** (which must never be exposed in client-side code). Deploy the companion proxy (e.g., on Vercel or Netlify Functions) and update `CONFIG.ebay.proxyURL`.

The proxy must implement:
- `POST /auth/token` — exchange authorization code for tokens (`redirect_uri` is sent in the request body as the RuName)
- `POST /auth/refresh` — refresh an expired access token

### Switching Between Production and Sandbox

- **Production** (default): uses `https://auth2.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize`
- **Sandbox**: uses `https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize`

To switch environments, set `environment` in `js/config.js`:

```js
environment: 'sandbox', // or 'production'
```

You can also change it at runtime via the **⚙️ Settings** panel in the dashboard — select the environment radio button and save.

> **Tip**: When using Sandbox, use Sandbox App IDs from the eBay Developer Portal (they are separate credentials from Production).
